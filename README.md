# Persona-MBTI

## General Info
I am friends with the Presidient of Sookmyung Women's Universities French Culture Society.<br>
The Society is also known as Persona.<br>
Due to the current COVID-19 situation the society members are unable to do any in-person events.<br>
In response to this my friend and I collaborated on an web app that people could enjoy safely<br>
<br>
The web app was made to accompany a retelling of La Réunification des deux Corées a play by French writer Joël Pommerat,<br>
performed by Persona society members<br>
The web app is comprised of a set of questions that the user asnwers, similiar to those found in a MBTI perosnality test.<br>
Once the user completes the questions they will be shown which charcter from the play they are the most similar to<br>
The user can then share this result on KakaoTalk<br>
<br>
Working on this project with a non-native English speaker gave me great insight into working as part of a global team.

## Technologies
* HTML5 
* CCS3
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* Kakao SDK

Bootstap did most of the heavy lifting here<br>
This was my first time using the Kakao SDK. This allowed users share their their results though KakaoTalk easily and helped the web app to spread.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by a tutorial series by 판다코딩.<br>
You can watch the series here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgqG2uj21HgmvkxcxKD0aYvF8zs0LGAES <br>
Watching this series was a unique way to improve my Korean listening skills.
